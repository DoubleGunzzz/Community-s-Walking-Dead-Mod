### Alpha Release v0.1

## Introduction

Welcome to Community's Walking Dead Mod, a zombie apocalypse mod for Grand Theft Auto 5. This has been inspired by the brilliant Simple Zombies mod by sollaholla (https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/simple-zombies).

Please note that this is an early Alpha release of the mod, and therefore there will undoubtably be bugs and missing features (such as crafting and base building). Please help by posting any problems you encounter either in the comments on the download page or on the forum thread.

## Current WIP Features



## Requirements

The downloads needed to make this mod run are:

* Script Hook V (v1.0.1868.0 or higher) - http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/
	
* Community Script Hook V .NET (v3.0.3 or higher) - https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet/releases/tag/v3.0.3
	
* .NET Framework (v4.8 or higher) - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48
	
* Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019 x64 - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads

* NativeUI (v1.9.1 or higher) - https://github.com/Guad/NativeUI/releases/tag/1.9.1

## Installation

To install this mod, first download and install the requirements listed in the section above. Then download and extract the zip file to your ‘/Scripts/’ directory, which should be located in your GTA main directory.

So for example, if your copy of GTA is from Steam and your game directory was located on your C: drive this would be:

> C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V\Scripts\

In your 'Scripts' folder you should now have the ‘UndeadStreets.dll’ file. Don't worry about the other directories and settings mentioned in this document, the mod will generate these the first time it runs.

Now startup your GTA 5 game and when the game has loaded, first disable the Autosave feature. The game *shouldn't* save anyway but this is just to be safe! Now press the F10 key (default key, can be customised in 'Settings.ini') and you can select your character model (Male or Female) and whether to have Fast Zombies (zombies who can run at you and scream a lot!). Then you can start the mod!

Once you've started the Undead Streets mod you cannot turn this off without reloading a save game from the main menu (not the mod menu, the game's main menu).

## Known Bugs/Errors

Known bugs that exist in the current Alpha release are:
	
* All (most?) doors/gates in the game that are usually locked will open. The upside is you can access some of the basic interiors, but the downside is that electric gates open automatically and there shouldn’t really be any electricity! I’m looking into somehow keeping the gates locked but the doors open
	
* Car headlights don’t work as the mod uses the game’s “blackout” feature, so that there are no lights or electricity. Not sure how to get around this one yet!

* The colours for text, UI and menus are a bit random and need to be standardised/simplified!

Again, if you find any other bugs please let me know in the comments section on the download page or on the forum thread.

## Planned Features

Planned features for future releases include:

- [ ] Crafting of basic objects and weapons, and placeable objects
	
- [ ] Placing objects on the map to enable base building
	
- [ ] Fixed bases at the prison, cultist camp and army base (and maybe other locations)
	
- [ ] Simple missions (such as obtaining items for survivors, rescuing survivors, transporting people, etc…) which will be given out at fixed bases

If you have any more ideas, please let me know in the comments section on the download page or on the forum thread.

Hope you enjoy this mod and keep watching this space for future releases!
